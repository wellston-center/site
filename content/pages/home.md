We have volunteer nurses to assist clients with blood pressure checks, answer questions on medications and provide general wellness advice.  The nurses are available during food pantry operations on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings.

Our thrift store is open to the public Friday and Saturday mornings starting at 9:00 am.  Available are New Balance shoes, clothing, furniture, jewelry, household items and other donated items.
