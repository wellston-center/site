save_as: about.html

As a Catholic, independent, community-based ministry, the St. Augustine Wellston Center promotes greater well-being of low-income people in the Wellston area. We strive to support people in mind, body, and soul by providing social services and food in a safe environment.

The St. Augustine Wellston Center is an outreach food pantry and thrift store for the Wellston community. The center was founded over 25 years ago by Sr. Mary Beckmann and Sr. Kathy Stark, Sisters of the Notre Dame along with Sr. Carol Ann Callahan, Sister of Mercy.

The center’s food pantry serves 300- 400 clients per month. Clients receive fresh produce, meat, eggs, milk, bread and canned foods to ensure access to healthy meals. The center offers services such as rent and utility assistance as well as health and dietary education.

Additionally, the thrift store is open to the public on Fridays and Saturdays and the proceeds from the store directly fund the food pantry. The thrift store donations come from parishes, individuals and the sale of New Balance shoes.

Volunteers are the lifeblood of the Wellston Center. Coming from several parishes throughout St. Louis, the volunteers keep the pantry and thrift store operational and welcoming to clients.
